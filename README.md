# Olympus COIN (Counter Insurgency) Operations
Olympus COIN Operation (OCO) missions attempt to provide DCS players with ready to play COIN mission sets built to utilize the Olympus (https://github.com/Pax1601/DCSOlympus) DCS mod. The goal is to provide a playing environment where players can cooperatively fight against AI insurgents with an Olympus commander. Players will utilize available assests to help aid the blue forces' ground units and secure victory including transport helicopters to deploy infantry units around the map!

# OCO Batumi Ablaze
Tensions boil over as the citizens of Batumi reach their breaking point. At the helm of the burgeoning rebellion, the insurgent leader issues a rallying cry, urging the sons and daughters of Batumi to seize arms and upend the incumbent government.
