# OCO Batumi Ablaze
Tensions boil over as the citizens of Batumi reach their breaking point. At the helm of the burgeoning rebellion, the insurgent leader issues a rallying cry, urging the sons and daughters of Batumi to seize arms and upend the incumbent government.

With a surge of fervor, insurgents boil forth from their bastions in Mahindzhauri and Hevachauri, converging upon the heart of the city. Georgian forces hastily mobilize, safeguarding vital assets like the Batumi airfield, alongside pivotal infrastructural linchpins such as the bustling port and the indispensable power plant.
